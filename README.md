# Project title
Q: Give your project a nice title.

# What and why?
Q: What software system would you like to build this semester, and why? Include a description of what problem the system would solve and why this is important.

The software system that we would like to build this semester is an app that tracks NYC subways in real time and alerts the user when to leave in order to catch their subway on time. Subways are often delayed and while there are MTA apps that allow one to see subway schedules, we would like to facilitate the process of calculating the correct time to depart in order not to be late to one's destination.

# For whom?
Q: Who will this software be for? These people are your end-users or customers.

This software will be for anyone that uses the NYC subway system regularly.

# How?
Q: A description of what the system will do from an end-user's perspective. Be as complete as necessary to fully explain the system, but do not worry about technical implementation - this will be developed in subsequent work.

The software will serve as a route planning system that integrates realtime bus and subway schedules provided by the MTA with a calculated average walking pace. The user can also set an alarm/alert to go off X minutes before they should leave in order to arrive at a specific destination at a specific time. The system will of course take into consideration delays, and possibly also weather conditions and other emergencies that may alter the estimated time of arrival to a destination. To explain the process of how a user would use the app:
The user defines a specific starting location and a specific destination, as well as a time for when they wish to arrive at their destination. The user will be able to save these starting location - destination - time presets for repeated use.

# Scope
Q: A brief justification that the proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitions for a group of approximately 4 - 6 programmers to undertake in one semester.
